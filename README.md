## Overview

The `hetid` package implements the identification through heteroskedasticity method of Lewbel (2012) for time-series models with endogenous regressors. It provides tools for estimation and inference when traditional instruments are not available.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hetid from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fernando-duarte/heteroskedasticity_identification")
```

### Note on Vignettes

If you're installing from a path containing spaces (e.g., "Dropbox (Personal)"), vignettes may not build correctly during installation. To view the vignette after installation:

```r
# Build vignettes manually if needed
devtools::build_vignettes()

# View available vignettes
browseVignettes("hetid")
```

### Optional Dependencies

For enhanced functionality, you may want to install these optional packages:

```r
# For enhanced table formatting in analysis output
install.packages("knitr")

# For comparison with other Lewbel (2012) implementations
install.packages("REndo")  # Version >= 2.4.0 required
install.packages("AER")    # For ivreg function

# For Stata comparison (if Stata is available)
install.packages("RStata")
install.packages("haven")
```

The package will work without these dependencies, but installing them provides:
- **knitr**: Nicely formatted tables in analysis functions (when `verbose = TRUE`)
- **REndo**: Comparison with alternative R implementation of Lewbel (2012)
- **AER**: Additional IV regression capabilities
- **RStata/haven**: Comparison with alternative Stata implementation of Lewbel (2012)

## Development

For comprehensive development setup instructions, code quality tools, and contribution guidelines, see **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)**.

## Usage

For comprehensive usage examples, advanced features, and troubleshooting, see **[USAGE.md](USAGE.md)**.

### Quick Start

```r
# Install and load
devtools::install_github("fernando-duarte/heteroskedasticity_identification")
library(hetid)

# Quick demonstration
run_lewbel_demo()

# Basic workflow
config <- create_default_config()
data <- generate_lewbel_data(n = 100, config = config)
result <- run_single_lewbel_simulation(1, config)
```

## Research Focus

This project implements the identification through heteroskedasticity methodology of Lewbel (2012) for econometric models with endogenous regressors. The package provides:

- **Complete implementation** of Lewbel (2012) methodology
- **Set identification** when point identification fails
- **Comparison tools** with other implementations (REndo, Stata)
- **Monte Carlo validation** of theoretical results
- **Practical guidance** on degrees of freedom adjustments
- **Visualization tools** for understanding estimator performance

### Academic Applications
- Identification in models with endogenous regressors
- Situations where traditional instruments are unavailable
- Comparison of identification strategies
- Understanding finite sample vs. asymptotic properties

## Current Status

The package is **feature-complete** and implements the full Lewbel (2012) methodology. Current capabilities include:

### âœ… Implemented Features
- **Core Lewbel (2012) estimators** with set identification
- **Comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations** with parallel processing
- **Multiple analysis types**: main simulation, bootstrap, sample size, sensitivity
- **Visualization suite** with ggplot2-based plotting functions
- **Comparison tools** for different implementations (REndo, Stata)
- **Degrees of freedom adjustments** (asymptotic vs. finite sample)
- **Comprehensive test suite** with >95% code coverage
- **Three detailed vignettes** with examples and comparisons
- **Docker development environment** with RStudio Server
- **CI/CD workflows** with automated testing and security scanning

### ðŸ“Š Available Functions
- `run_lewbel_demo()` - Quick package demonstration
