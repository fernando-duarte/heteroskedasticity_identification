#' @details
#' The triangular model consists of two equations:
#' \deqn{Y_1 = X'\beta_1 + \gamma_1 Y_2 + \epsilon_1}
#' \deqn{Y_2 = X'\beta_2 + \epsilon_2}
#'
#' where Y_1 is the outcome variable, Y_2 is the endogenous regressor,
#' X is a vector of exogenous variables, and (\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2) are
#' the structural errors.
