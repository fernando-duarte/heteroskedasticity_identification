# Docker Optimization Status

## ✅ Completed Optimizations

### 1. GitHub Actions Cache Fix (Phase 0)
- **Status**: ✅ v2 deployed
- **Changes**: Conservative cache configuration to prevent competition
- **Impact**: Should stabilize CI/CD build times

### 2. TinyTeX Implementation
- **Status**: ✅ Just deployed
- **Changes**: Replaced ~3-4GB texlive with ~150MB TinyTeX
- **Impact**:
  - Docker images ~3GB smaller
  - Faster builds (5-10 minutes less)
  - Better ARM64 compatibility
  - Reduced cache pressure

## 🔄 In Progress

Waiting for GitHub Actions to confirm:
1. Cache fix is working (no more flip-flopping)
2. TinyTeX builds successfully
3. Docker tests pass

## 📋 Next Steps (Once Builds Are Stable)

### Phase 1: pak for Parallel R Package Installation
- Replace `install.packages()` with `pak::pkg_install()`
- Expected: 40-50% faster package installation

### Phase 2: Optimize Layer Ordering
- Move package installation before source copy
- Prevent cache invalidation on code changes

### Phase 3: Further Optimizations
- Consider reducing cache mode back to `min`
- Implement conditional builds
- Add cache warming job

## 🎯 Target Metrics

- **Before**: 20-30 minute builds
- **Current**: ~15-20 minutes (after TinyTeX)
- **Goal**: 5-10 minutes (after all optimizations)

## 📝 Notes

- Monitor next 2-3 workflow runs to ensure stability
- If builds fail, check logs for TinyTeX installation issues
- Cache cleanup script available if needed: `docker/scripts/cache-cleanup.sh`
