# PR Review Fixes Applied

## Summary
All issues identified in the PR review have been addressed. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. ✅ r-security.yml - Missing `remotes` package
**Issue**: Workflow tried to use `remotes::install_github()` without ensuring it was installed
**Fix**: 
- Added `any::remotes` and `any::pak` to the setup-r-dependencies step
- Added proper checks for package availability before using them
- Added fallback to `install.packages()` if neither pak nor remotes are available

### 2. ✅ docker.yml - Brittle image tag extraction
**Issue**: Used grep pattern that assumed specific repository name patterns
**Fix**:
- Now saves image tags to artifact files during build
- Test jobs download and read tag artifacts instead of grepping docker images
- More robust and works regardless of repository name

### 3. ✅ R-CMD-check.yml - Undefined http-user-agent parameter
**Issue**: Referenced `matrix.config.http-user-agent` which wasn't defined
**Fix**: Removed the undefined parameter reference

### 4. ✅ WORKFLOWS.md - Duplicate Docker workflow description
**Issue**: Docker workflow was described twice (sections 2 and 5)
**Fix**: Removed the duplicate section 5

### 5. ✅ test_workflows.sh - References to potentially missing files
**Issue**: Script showed example commands for files that might not exist
**Fix**: Added file existence checks before displaying act commands
