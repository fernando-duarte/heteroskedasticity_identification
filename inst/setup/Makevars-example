# For M1/M2 Macs, you might also need:
# FC = /opt/homebrew/bin/gfortran
# F77 = /opt/homebrew/bin/gfortran
# FLIBS = -L/opt/homebrew/lib/gcc/13

# Alternative if you have Homebrew GCC installed:
# CC = /opt/homebrew/bin/gcc-13
# CXX = /opt/homebrew/bin/g++-13

# For Intel Macs with older gfortran:
# FC = /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran
# F77 = /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran
# FLIBS = -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib
