# CI/CD Impact Analysis: Pre-commit Configuration

## Short Answer

**No, the compilation error and local pre-commit configuration will NOT affect your GitHub Actions workflows.**

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows (✅ Not Affected)

Your GitHub Actions workflows (`rworkflows.yml` and `pkgdown.yml`) run independently of pre-commit:

```yaml
# rworkflows.yml uses neurogenomics/rworkflows action
- uses: neurogenomics/rworkflows@v1
  with:
    run_rcmdcheck: ${{ true }}
    run_covr: ${{ true }}
    # ... other R package checks
```

These workflows:
- Install their own R environment
- Don't use pre-commit hooks
- Run R CMD check and other package checks directly
- Will continue to work regardless of pre-commit configuration

### 2. Pre-commit.ci (⚠️ Would Be Affected)

If you enable pre-commit.ci (free for open source projects), it would fail with the original configuration due to:
- Compilation errors when installing R packages
- renv isolation issues with digest 0.6.36

**However**, with the local hooks configuration:
```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: style-files
      language: system  # ← This is the problem
```

Pre-commit.ci **cannot run** `language: system` hooks because:
- It runs in a cloud environment without your local R installation
- It can't access your system's R packages
- It needs self-contained hook definitions

### 3. Solutions for CI Integration

#### Option A: Keep Current Setup
- ✅ GitHub Actions work fine (R CMD check, tests, coverage)
- ✅ Local pre-commit hooks work perfectly
- ❌ Can't use pre-commit.ci

#### Option B: Add pre-commit to GitHub Actions
Create `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml`:
```yaml
name: pre-commit
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
    - name: Install R packages
      run: |
        install.packages(c("styler", "lintr", "roxygen2", "desc", "spelling"))
      shell: Rscript {0}
    - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.1
```

#### Option C: Use Standard Hooks in CI Only
Maintain two configurations:
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Local hooks (current)
- `.pre-commit-config-ci.yaml` - Standard hooks only (no R hooks)

### 4. Impact Summary

| System | Current Local Hooks | Original renv Hooks |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Local Development** | ✅ Works perfectly | ❌ Compilation errors |
| **GitHub Actions** | ✅ Not affected | ✅ Not affected |
| **pre-commit.ci** | ❌ Can't run system hooks | ❌ Compilation errors |
| **Custom CI with pre-commit** | ✅ Works with setup | ❌ Compilation errors |

### 5. Recommendations

1. **Current Setup is Fine**: Your GitHub Actions will continue to work normally
2. **For Full CI Coverage**: Consider adding a separate GitHub Action to run pre-commit
3. **Monitor Updates**: When lorenzwalthert/precommit updates to digest 0.6.37+, you can switch back to standard hooks

### 6. What's Actually Running in CI

Your current CI runs:
- ✅ R CMD check (syntax, examples, tests)
- ✅ Test coverage with covr
- ✅ Unit tests with testthat
- ✅ Vignette building
- ✅ Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Missing from CI (but covered locally):
- Code formatting with styler
- Linting with lintr
- Spell checking
- Debug statement detection

These are primarily development-time concerns, so having them only in local pre-commit is perfectly reasonable.
