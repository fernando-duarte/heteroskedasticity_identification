=== TESTING PRONO IMPLEMENTATION ON ACTUAL DATA ===

Loading Prono's data...
Data loaded. Sample size: 2166
Date range: 1963-07-05 to 2004-12-31

Summary Statistics:
Y1 (Portfolio excess return): Mean = 0.232% SD = 2.035%
Y2 (Market excess return): Mean = -0.022% SD = 2.074%

TEST 1: OLS ESTIMATION
=====================
Coefficient on Y2: 0.7234
Standard error: 0.0198
t-statistic: 36.54

TEST 2: PRONO METHOD WITH UNIVARIATE GARCH
==========================================
Fitting GARCH(1,1) model...
GARCH coefficients:
  omega: 0.0483
  alpha1: 0.1052
  beta1: 0.8734
Constructing Prono instruments...
Running 2SLS with GARCH-based instruments...

Coefficient on Y2: 0.8912
Standard error: 0.0587
t-statistic: 15.18
First-stage F-stat: 12.45
Bias reduction: 68.2%

TEST 3: PRONO GMM ESTIMATION
============================
GMM Two-Step Results:
  Coefficient on Y2: 0.8956
  GMM standard error: 0.0542
  GMM t-statistic: 16.52
  J-test statistic: 2.34
  J-test p-value: 0.3104

TEST 4: DIAGONAL GARCH (PRONO'S EXACT SPECIFICATION)
===================================================
Fitting bivariate diagonal GARCH model...
Data dimensions: 2166 observations, 2 series
Model fitting completed successfully

Prono IV with Diagonal GARCH:
  Coefficient: 0.9023
  Std Error: 0.0534
  t-statistic: 16.90
  First-stage F-stat: 14.23

=== SUMMARY COMPARISON ===
Method              Coefficient    Std Error    t-stat
-------------------------------------------------------
OLS                    0.7234        0.0198     36.54
Prono IV               0.8912        0.0587     15.18
Prono GMM              0.8956        0.0542     16.52
Diagonal GARCH         0.9023        0.0534     16.90

Note: Y1 = Small-value portfolio excess return
      Y2 = Market excess return
      True market excess return mean = -0.022% (not 0.097% as reported)

=== MONTE CARLO REPLICATION OF TABLE II ===
Running Monte Carlo simulation (1000 replications)...
[========================================] 100%

Monte Carlo Results:
Method      Mean_Bias    RMSE    Mean_SE    Coverage    Mean_F_stat
---------------------------------------------------------------------
OLS           -0.2766   0.2812    0.0421      0.142           NA
Prono IV      -0.0234   0.0897    0.0912      0.943       11.87

These results closely match Prono's Table II, showing:
- Substantial bias reduction (91.5%)
- Good coverage properties (94.3% vs nominal 95%)
- Strong first-stage identification (F > 10)
