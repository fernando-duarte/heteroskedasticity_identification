# CI/CD Workflows Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for all GitHub Actions workflows used in the `hetid` R package.

## Overview

The `hetid` package uses a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, security, and reproducibility. Our workflows are designed to:

- ‚úÖ Test the package across multiple operating systems and R versions
- üê≥ Build and test Docker containers
- üìñ Generate and deploy documentation
- üîí Perform Docker security scanning
- üîÑ Maintain up-to-date dependencies

## Workflow Files

### 1. R Package Check Workflow (`R-CMD-check.yml`)

**Purpose**: Main CI/CD workflow for R package testing and checking across multiple platforms.

**Triggers**:
- Push to branches: `main`, `master`
- Pull requests to the same branches
- Release publications

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-platform testing**: Runs on Ubuntu 22.04, macOS latest, and Windows latest
- **R versions**: Tests against `release` and `oldrel` versions
- **Concurrency control**: Smart concurrency with `cancel-in-progress: true`
- **Comprehensive checks**: Runs R CMD check with CRAN standards

**Matrix Configuration**:
```yaml
- Ubuntu 22.04 with R release
- Ubuntu 22.04 with R oldrel  
- macOS latest with R release
- Windows latest with R release
```

**Dependencies**: Uses `r-lib/actions` for standardized R package workflows.

### 2. Docker Workflow (`docker.yml`)

**Purpose**: Build, test, and deploy Docker containers for the R package.

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` and `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Tags matching `v*`
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-stage builds**: Separate `builder`, `production`, and `development` targets
- **Security scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning with SARIF upload
- **Multi-architecture support**: Builds for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
- **GitHub Container Registry**: Pushes images to `ghcr.io`
- **Comprehensive testing**: Tests package installation and functionality in containers

**Build Matrix**:
- Builder image: Development dependencies
- Production image: Minimal runtime environment
- Development image: Full development environment with RStudio

**Security**: Scans all images and uploads results to GitHub Security tab.

### 3. Documentation Workflow (`pkgdown.yml`)

**Purpose**: Build and deploy package documentation website using pkgdown.

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` or `master` branches
- Pull requests to the same branches
- Release publications
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Key Features**:
- **GitHub Pages deployment**: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Artifact upload**: Stores built documentation as artifacts
- **Conditional deployment**: Only deploys on non-PR events
- **R setup**: Uses public RSPM for package installation

**Process**:
1. Builds documentation with `pkgdown::build_site_github_pages()`
2. Uploads as artifact
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages environment

### 4. R Security Workflow (`r-security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security analysis for R packages including vulnerability scanning, license checking, and code quality.

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches (when R files change)
- Pull requests to `main` (when R files change)
- Weekly schedule (Mondays at 3 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Key Features**:
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Uses oysteR for dependency vulnerability detection (optional)
- **License compatibility**: Checks for license conflicts
- **Security linting**: Detects potentially unsafe code patterns
- **SBOM generation**: Creates Software Bill of Materials in CycloneDX format
- **Good practices**: Runs goodpractice checks

**Security Checks**:
1. Dependency vulnerability scanning with oysteR (if available)
2. License compatibility analysis
3. Security-focused code linting (system calls, eval, etc.)
4. Code quality and complexity analysis
5. SBOM generation for supply chain security

### 5. Docker Workflow (`docker.yml`)

**Purpose**: Build, test, and deploy Docker containers with integrated security scanning.

**Key Features**:
- **Dockerfile scanning**: Security analysis of Docker configurations using Trivy
- **Image vulnerability scanning**: Scans built Docker images for vulnerabilities
- **SARIF integration**: Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Multi-severity scanning**: Checks for CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM severity issues

**Scan Types**:
1. **Dockerfile security**: Vulnerability scanning of all Dockerfiles
2. **Container image scanning**: Security analysis of built Docker images
3. **Workflow security**: Security analysis of GitHub Actions workflows using Trivy

## Concurrency Management

All workflows implement concurrency controls to prevent resource waste:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

This ensures that:
- Only one workflow run per branch/PR at a time
- New pushes cancel in-progress runs
- Resources are used efficiently

## Security Features

### 1. Dependency Scanning
- Dependabot monitors all dependencies
- Weekly updates for GitHub Actions
- Monthly updates for R packages

### 2. Container Security
- Trivy scans all Docker images
- Vulnerabilities uploaded to Security tab
- Scans for CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM severity issues

### 3. Workflow Security
- Trivy scanning of GitHub Actions workflows
- Configuration security analysis
- Automated vulnerability detection

## Runner Specifications

All workflows use pinned runner versions for reproducibility:

| Workflow | Runner | Version |
|----------|--------|---------|
| R-CMD-check | Ubuntu | 22.04 |
| R-CMD-check | macOS | latest |
| R-CMD-check | Windows | latest |
| docker | Ubuntu | 22.04 |
| pkgdown | Ubuntu | 22.04 |
| r-security | Ubuntu | 22.04 |

## Secrets and Permissions

### Required Secrets
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub
- `DOCKER_TOKEN`: Optional, for DockerHub (not currently used)
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Optional, for Codecov uploads

### Permissions
Workflows request only necessary permissions:
- `contents: read` - Read repository content
- `packages: write` - Push Docker images
- `pages: write` - Deploy documentation
- `security-events: write` - Upload security results

## Best Practices

1. **Version Pinning**: All actions use specific versions (e.g., `@v4`, `@v3`)
2. **Matrix Testing**: Test across multiple OS and R versions
3. **Caching**: Use GitHub Actions cache for dependencies
4. **Artifacts**: Store test results and built packages
5. **Security First**: Regular scanning and updates

## Workflow Status Badges

The README displays real-time status badges for all workflows:
- R-CMD-check status
- Docker build status
- Documentation deployment status

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Dependabot proposes updates weekly/monthly
- Review and merge security updates promptly
- Test major version updates on feature branches

### Monitoring
- Check workflow run history regularly
- Monitor for deprecation warnings
- Review security alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **R Package Installation Failures**
   - Check DESCRIPTION file dependencies
   - Verify system dependencies in workflows

2. **Docker Build Failures**
   - Check Dockerfile syntax
   - Verify base image availability

3. **Documentation Build Failures**
   - Ensure all examples run without errors
   - Check for missing dependencies

### Getting Help
- Check workflow logs in the Actions tab
- Review similar issues in the repository
- Consult the r-lib/actions documentation

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements:
- Performance monitoring metrics
- Workflow failure notifications
- Additional security scanning tools
- Improved caching strategies
