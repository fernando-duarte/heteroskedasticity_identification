# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes Summary

## Overview
All CI/CD workflows have been reviewed and fixed to address failing builds. The main issues were related to outdated dependency installation methods and overly complex artifact handling.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. R-CMD-check.yml
**Problems:**
- Manual dependency installation was failing
- R devel version might have compatibility issues

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Replaced manual `remotes::install_deps()` with `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2`
- ✅ Changed R `devel` to `oldrel` for better stability
- ✅ Added `--no-manual` and `--as-cran` arguments to R CMD check

### 2. docker.yml
**Problems:**
- Complex tag file artifact handling was causing failures
- Image loading was failing due to missing tag files

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Removed separate tag file artifacts
- ✅ Simplified image loading to extract tags directly from loaded images
- ✅ Reduced artifact retention and disabled compression for Docker images
- ✅ Removed tag artifact references from cleanup job

### 3. pkgdown.yml
**Problems:**
- Manual dependency installation could fail

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Replaced manual installation with `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2`
- ✅ Added proper `needs: website` configuration

### 4. r-security.yml
**Problems:**
- Extremely complex oysteR installation with multiple fallback methods
- Overly complex job structure with unnecessary caching
- Many steps were failing due to complexity

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Complete rewrite with simplified single-job structure
- ✅ Made oysteR installation optional (continue-on-error)
- ✅ Simplified SARIF generation
- ✅ Added proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Removed complex caching logic
- ✅ Used standard r-lib/actions patterns

### 5. WORKFLOWS.md
**Problems:**
- Documentation referenced non-existent `rworkflows.yml`
- Missing documentation for r-security workflow

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Updated to correctly reference `R-CMD-check.yml`
- ✅ Added comprehensive r-security workflow documentation
- ✅ Updated runner specifications table
- ✅ Added information about additional workflows
- ✅ Fixed references from neurogenomics to r-lib

## Key Improvements

1. **Standardization**: All workflows now use `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2` for consistent dependency management
2. **Simplification**: Removed unnecessary complexity, especially in Docker and security workflows
3. **Reliability**: Added `continue-on-error` for optional steps to prevent workflow failures
4. **Documentation**: Updated WORKFLOWS.md to accurately reflect actual workflow files

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: 
   - Push changes to a feature branch
   - Create a pull request to trigger all workflows
   - Monitor GitHub Actions tab for results

2. **Configuration**:
   - Set up `OSSINDEX_USER` and `OSSINDEX_TOKEN` repository secrets for better oysteR functionality
   - Consider enabling GitHub Pages if pkgdown deployment fails

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Watch for any deprecation warnings in workflow logs
   - Check if all matrix builds pass successfully

## Expected Outcomes

After these fixes, all workflows should:
- ✅ Pass syntax validation
- ✅ Install dependencies successfully
- ✅ Complete their primary tasks without errors
- ✅ Handle optional features gracefully

The workflows are now more maintainable, following current best practices from r-lib/actions and GitHub Actions documentation.
