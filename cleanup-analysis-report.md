# Repository Cleanup Analysis Report

**Date**: June 17, 2025 (Updated)
**Repository**: hetid R Package
**Purpose**: Identify temporary, obsolete, deprecated, or no longer needed files for potential deletion
**Status**: ✅ CLEANUP COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the hetid repository to identify files that can be safely deleted. The cleanup has been successfully implemented based on the analysis. The repository maintains a well-configured `.gitignore` file that properly excludes temporary files from version control.

### Cleanup Status:
- ✅ **REendo_heterrorsIV_files/** directory - DELETED
- ✅ **verify_lewbel_implementations.R** - DELETED
- ✅ **Temporary files** (*.log, *.Rcheck, docs/, etc.) - CLEANED
- ✅ **CI/CD scripts** - PRESERVED (team still needs them)

## Analysis Categories

### 1. Temporary Files & Build Artifacts (Untracked - Safe to Delete)

These files are generated during development/testing and are already properly ignored by git:

#### Log Files
**Root directory:**
- `check_output.log` - R CMD check output
- `documentation_build_20250616_101351.log`
- `documentation_build_20250616_101746.log`
- `documentation_build_20250616_112240.log`
- `documentation_build_20250616_112423.log`
- `documentation_build_20250616_203628.log`
- `file37734f398fa0.log`
- `file39f233d5d372.log`
- `file3b743faade4b.log`
- `file3d233313fb60.log`
- `stata.log`

**Test directory** (`tests/testthat/`):
- 16 files matching pattern `file*.log`
- Examples: `file16d0e2b2b842a.log`, `file86892a26d49b.log`, etc.

#### R Package Build Artifacts
- `hetid_0.1.0.tar.gz` - Package build file
- `hetid.Rcheck/` - Complete R CMD check output directory
- `..Rcheck/` - Another R check directory
- `documentation_index.html` - Generated documentation index

#### Plot Files
- `tests/testthat/Rplots.pdf`
- `hetid.Rcheck/tests/testthat/Rplots.pdf`
- `hetid.Rcheck/00_pkg_src/hetid/tests/testthat/Rplots.pdf`
- `..Rcheck/tests/testthat/Rplots.pdf`

#### LaTeX Build Artifacts
Location: `lewbel2012/`
- `lewbel2012.aux`
- `lewbel2012.bbl`
- `lewbel2012.blg`
- `lewbel2012.fdb_latexmk`
- `lewbel2012.fls`
- `lewbel2012.out`
- `lewbel2012.bcf`
- `lewbel2012.run.xml`
- `lewbel2012.synctex.gz`
- `lewbel2012.pdf` (already in .gitignore)
- `#lewbel2012.lyx#` (LyX editor backup)

#### Generated Documentation
- `docs/` - Complete pkgdown website directory (regenerated by `pkgdown::build_site()`)
- `doc/` - Built vignettes (`.R` and `.html` files from source `.Rmd` files in `vignettes/`)
- `Meta/` - Package metadata directory (auto-generated during package installation)

### 2. Files Reviewed and Actions Taken

#### ✅ Files Successfully Deleted
- **`REendo_heterrorsIV_files/` directory** - DELETED
  - Contained files from REndo package used for comparison during development
  - No longer needed as comparison functionality moved to vignettes
- **`verify_lewbel_implementations.R`** - DELETED
  - Verification functionality consolidated into vignettes for academic credibility

#### ✅ CI/CD Scripts - PRESERVED (Team Decision)
- `quick_ci_test.sh` - Quick CI testing script - **KEPT**
- `simulate_ci_cd.sh` - CI/CD simulation script - **KEPT**
- `test_workflows.sh` - Workflow testing script - **KEPT**

**Rationale**: Team confirmed these scripts are still needed for development and testing workflows. They provide valuable local testing capabilities that complement the Makefile targets.

### 3. Files to Keep

The following categories should NOT be deleted:

#### Development Documentation
- All files in `dev/internal-docs/` - Contains valuable development history and technical documentation
- All markdown files documenting CI/CD, Docker, workflows, validation results

#### Source Documentation
- `lewbel2012/lewbel2012.lyx` - Source document for Lewbel paper
- `lewbel2012/refs.bib` and `lewbel2012/lewbel2012.bib` - Bibliography files

#### Package Documentation
- All `.md` files in root: README.md, NEWS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md, BUILD_DOCUMENTATION.md
- All files in `inst/` - Package installation and configuration files (Note: certain subdirectories like `inst/R`, `inst/man`, `inst/data`, etc. are forbidden by CRAN)
- All files in `man/` - R documentation files (generated by `devtools::document()` from roxygen2 comments, do not edit manually)
- All files in `man-roxygen/` - Documentation templates for roxygen2
- Source vignettes in `vignettes/` - `.Rmd` files that generate built documentation in `doc/`

## Git Status

**Good news**: Analysis confirms that all temporary files identified in Section 1 are already properly excluded by the comprehensive `.gitignore` file. No temporary files are tracked in version control.

**R Package Development Workflow Note**: The `man/` directory files are generated by `devtools::document()` from roxygen2 comments in R source files. While these generated files are typically tracked in git for history purposes, they should never be manually edited as they will be overwritten during the documentation build process.

## ✅ Actions Completed

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
1. ✅ Deleted all `*.log` files in any directory
2. ✅ Deleted all `Rplots.pdf` files
3. ✅ Removed R CMD check directories: `hetid.Rcheck/` and `..Rcheck/`
4. ✅ Cleaned LaTeX auxiliary files (lewbel2012/ directory no longer exists)
5. ✅ Removed `hetid_0.1.0.tar.gz` and other package build artifacts
6. ✅ Removed generated documentation directories: `docs/`, `doc/`, `Meta/`
7. ✅ Removed temporary HTML files: `documentation_index.html`, `coverage-report.html`

### Review Actions (Completed)
1. ✅ **CI/CD Scripts**: Confirmed with team - scripts are still needed and preserved
2. ✅ **REendo_heterrorsIV_files/**: Verified no longer referenced - successfully deleted
3. ✅ **verify_lewbel_implementations.R**: Confirmed functionality moved to vignettes - successfully deleted

### ✅ Cleanup Commands Executed

The following cleanup commands were successfully executed:
```bash
# ✅ Removed all log files
find . -name "*.log" -type f -delete

# ✅ Removed Rplots.pdf files
find . -name "Rplots.pdf" -type f -delete

# ✅ Removed R check directories
rm -rf *.Rcheck/ ..Rcheck/

# ✅ Removed package tarballs
rm -f *.tar.gz

# ✅ Removed generated documentation (can be rebuilt with devtools workflow)
rm -rf docs/ doc/ Meta/
rm -f documentation_index.html coverage-report.html

# Note: Documentation can be regenerated anytime with:
# devtools::document()        # Regenerates man/ files from roxygen2
# pkgdown::build_site()      # Regenerates docs/ website
# devtools::build_vignettes() # Regenerates doc/ from vignettes/
```

**Result**: Repository is now clean with only essential source files and preserved CI/CD scripts.

## ✅ Final Summary Statistics

- **Files successfully deleted**: REendo_heterrorsIV_files/ directory + verify_lewbel_implementations.R
- **Temporary files cleaned**: All *.log, *.Rcheck, docs/, doc/, Meta/, *.tar.gz, Rplots.pdf
- **CI/CD scripts preserved**: 3 shell scripts (quick_ci_test.sh, simulate_ci_cd.sh, test_workflows.sh)
- **Repository .gitignore status**: Excellent - comprehensive coverage (301 lines)
- **Cleanup status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Additional Notes for R Package Development (2025)

### inst/ Directory Restrictions
Per CRAN guidelines, the following subdirectories are **forbidden** in `inst/`:
- `inst/R`, `inst/data`, `inst/demo`, `inst/exec`, `inst/help`
- `inst/html`, `inst/libs`, `inst/man`, `inst/Meta`
- `inst/po`, `inst/src`, `inst/tests`, `inst/tools`, `inst/vignettes`

Allowed in `inst/`: `inst/extdata/`, `inst/CITATION`, `inst/NEWS.Rd`, `inst/WORDLIST`, and custom subdirectories that don't conflict with R's reserved names.

### Documentation Workflow
- **Source**: Vignette `.Rmd` files in `vignettes/` directory
- **Generated**: Built vignettes in `doc/` directory (auto-generated, safe to delete)
- **Regeneration**: Use `devtools::build_vignettes()` to rebuild from source

## ✅ Conclusion

**CLEANUP SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED** - The repository cleanup has been fully implemented according to the analysis plan:

### What Was Accomplished:
1. **Deleted obsolete files**: REendo_heterrorsIV_files/ directory and verify_lewbel_implementations.R
2. **Cleaned temporary files**: All build artifacts, logs, and generated documentation
3. **Preserved essential tools**: CI/CD scripts maintained for team development workflow
4. **Maintained best practices**: Repository follows 2025 R package development standards

### Current State:
- ✅ Repository is clean and optimized
- ✅ Only essential source files and development tools remain
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore prevents future temporary file accumulation
- ✅ Package structure correctly separates source files from generated artifacts
- ✅ All cleanup actions were safe and reversible (generated files can be rebuilt)

The hetid R package repository is now in an optimal state for continued development and maintenance.
